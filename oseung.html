                    <h2>Introduce</h2>
                    <p>I am currently a Hongik university student(2nd grade).<br>
                        and I'm majoring in <b>Department of Software and Communications Engineering.</b><br>
                        I learned Python, C, and data structure.</p>

                    <h2>I want to be a <b>developer.</b></h2>
                    <p>I liked to imagine, and in the process of studying programming on my own, the process of using imagination and logic to solve problems felt very interesting.</p>
                    <p>In particular, as I investigated the difficult and complex problems myself, I finally felt a great sense of accomplishment in the moments when programming worked normally.</p>
                    <p>After that, I studied coding and thought about detailed career paths.</p>
                    <p>The area of development that really interested me was web programming, first of all, where you need to be familiar with design and where interaction with users is important.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, I would like to study the area of information security, which is the biggest problem in the game industry right now, which is preventing a lot of nuclear programs.</p>
