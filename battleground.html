                    <p><b>Battleground</b> is a PVP shooting game in which up to 100 players fight in the form of Battle Royale, with the winner or team that survived to the end. The battle paths of the plane on the map vary for each round and the player must determine the optimal time for escape and parachute landing. Players can customize only costumes that do not affect game play and start without weapons. When landing, players can search buildings, ghost cities and other areas for weapons, vehicles and other equipment. These items are systematically dispersed around the map at the start of the game and there are high-risk areas with some better equipment.</p>
